TectonicsManager:

	Holds all Plates Data etc.

Plates:



Borders Key-Value pair of : Key-Index of neighbour, value = vector of border vertex




PresssureMap:
	Accepts data and handles making maps

Do elevation and plate movement 
calculate plate type based on elevation: + Land , - Ocean

calculate deltas of velocity vectors v: v1 = movement1*magnitude1;

delta =  Max(v1-v2,v2-v1);

if delta + => moving from each other -> plains etc
if delta - => coming closer -> hills, mountains

Calculate mountains.


Split plates into smaller regions as Mountains,hills, plains etc of similar type.



	1.Grab ALL water at equator regions
	2. Move along wind north and South
	3. Dumping a bit overTime
	4.Mountains create big dump zones with possible shadowing anything beyond (create plains bushlands beyond)
	5. move until Poles where hurricanes are created and move towards beaches

Direction calculus:


Dot . Product:

v1.v2 > 0 => point in same direction
v1<v2 < point in oposite dir -> 



Sum components of the vectors to get resultant vector v3 = (v1.x+v2.x, v1.y+v2.y)
